Jasper is a 5-year-old boy living in the city with his single mother, who works as a psychologist. Jasper is a curious and imaginative child who loves science fiction and dreams of having his own robot friend. One day, his mother takes him to an exhibition at the space museum, where Jasper becomes fascinated with a Mars model on display. After begging his mother to buy him the toy version of Mars, they return home. While playing with it, Jasper accidentally drops it and discovers a small, mysterious robot hidden inside. Excited to have found his own robot friend, Jasper tries to activate it, but the robot remains unresponsive.

Jasper becomes obsessed with figuring out how to activate the robot. He tries everything he can think of, but nothing seems to work. His mother suggests that he take the robot to a specialist for repair, but Jasper refuses to let anyone else handle his precious discovery. One night, Jasper falls asleep while holding the robot and has a dream in which he and the robot go on an adventure together. In the dream, Jasper discovers that the robot is from another world and possesses a higher level of intelligence than anything he's ever seen. He wakes up with a renewed determination to find a way to awaken the robot.

Jasper finally discovers that the robot requires a human bond to activate its power source. He learns that the robot can only be activated by someone who truly cares for it, and the bond must be strong enough to generate warmth and emotional energy. Jasper spends every waking moment with the robot, playing games and reading stories to it, and even sleeping with it every night. After a few days, the robot suddenly springs to life, much to Jasper's delight. He is amazed by the robot's abilities and its advanced technology, which far surpasses anything he has ever seen. Jasper and the robot become inseparable friends, and thus, their story begins.
